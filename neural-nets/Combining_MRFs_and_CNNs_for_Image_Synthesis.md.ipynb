    "# Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* What\n",
    "  * They describe a method that applies the style of a source image to a target image.\n",
    "    * Example: Let a normal photo look like a van Gogh painting.\n",
    "    * Example: Let a normal car look more like a specific luxury car.\n",
    "  * Their method builds upon the well known [artistic style paper](A_Neural_Algorithm_for_Artistic_Style.md) and uses a new MRF prior.\n",
    "  * The prior leads to locally more plausible patterns (e.g. less artifacts).\n",
    "\n",
    "* How\n",
    "  * They reuse the content loss from the [artistic style paper](A_Neural_Algorithm_for_Artistic_Style.md).\n",
    "    * The content loss was calculated by feed the source and target image through a network (here: VGG19) and then estimating the squared error of the euclidean distance between one or more hidden layer activations.\n",
    "    * They use layer `relu4_2` for the distance measurement.\n",
    "  * They replace the original style loss with a MRF based style loss.\n",
    "    * Step 1: Extract from the source image `k x k` sized overlapping patches.\n",
    "    * Step 2: Perform step (1) analogously for the target image.\n",
    "    * Step 3: Feed the source image patches through a pretrained network (here: VGG19) and select the representations `r_s` from specific hidden layers (here: `relu3_1`, `relu4_1`).\n",
    "    * Step 4: Perform step (3) analogously for the target image. (Result: `r_t`)\n",
    "    * Step 5: For each patch of `r_s` find the best matching patch in `r_t` (based on normalized cross correlation).\n",
    "    * Step 6: Calculate the sum of squared errors (based on euclidean distances) of each patch in `r_s` and its best match (according to step 5).\n",
    "  * They add a regularizer loss.\n",
    "    * The loss encourages smooth transitions in the synthesized image (i.e. few edges, corners).\n",
    "    * It is based on the raw pixel values of the last synthesized image.\n",
    "    * For each pixel in the synthesized image, they calculate the squared x-gradient and the squared y-gradient and then add both.\n",
    "    * They use the sum of all those values as their loss (i.e. `regularizer loss = <sum over all pixels> x-gradient^2 + y-gradient^2`).\n",
    "  * Their whole optimization problem is then roughly `image = argmin_image MRF-style-loss + alpha1 * content-loss + alpha2 * regularizer-loss`.\n",
    "  * In practice, they start their synthesis with a low resolution image and then progressively increase the resolution (each time performing some iterations of optimization).\n",
    "  * In practice, they sample patches from the style image under several different rotations and scalings.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Results\n",
    "  * In comparison to the original artistic style paper:\n",
    "    * Less artifacts.\n",
    "    * Their method tends to preserve style better, but content worse.\n",
    "    * Can handle photorealistic style transfer better, so long as the images are similar enough. If no good matches between patches can be found, their method performs worse.\n",
