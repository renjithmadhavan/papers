    "# Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* What\n",
    "  * The well known method of [Artistic Style Transfer](A_Neural_Algorithm_for_Artistic_Style.md) can be used to generate new texture images (from an existing example) by skipping the content loss and only using the style loss.\n",
    "  * The method however can have problems with large scale structures and quasi-periodic patterns.\n",
    "  * They add a new loss based on the spectrum of the images (synthesized image and style image), which decreases these problems and handles especially periodic patterns well.\n",
    "\n",
    "* How\n",
    "  * Everything is handled in the same way as in the Artistic Style Transfer paper (without content loss).\n",
    "  * On top of that they add their spectrum loss:\n",
    "    * The loss is based on a squared distance, i.e. `1/2 d(I_s, I_t)^2`.\n",
    "      * `I_s` is the last synthesized image.\n",
    "      * `I_t` is the texture example.\n",
    "    * `d(I_s, I_t)` then does the following:\n",
    "      * It assumes that `I_t` is an example for a space of target images.\n",
    "      * Within that set it finds the image `I_p` which is most similar to `I_s`. That is done using a projection via Fourier Transformations. (See formula 5 in the paper.)\n",
    "      * The returned distance is then `I_s - I_p`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Results\n",
    "  * Equal quality for textures without quasi-periodic structures.\n",
    "  * Significantly better quality for textures with quasi-periodic structures.\n",
